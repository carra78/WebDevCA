	<h3><em>Recent Reviews</em></h3>
	<h5>Duncan - London</h5>
	<p><em>A very nice B&amp;B, really a guesthouse as the name implies, that sits right in the heart of Galway. Everything was a short 5-10 walk away.
	The room was nicely comfortable with a spacious en suite bathroom. <br>Breakfast was excellent and ample.
	Ellen is a very pleasant and energetic woman that made our stay memorable.
	Thanks to Ellen for her assistance in identifying places to eat, drink, and listen to music! We highly recommend Ellen’s B&amp;B Guesthouse</em></p>

	<P class="altcom"><em>We stayed at Ellen’s Guesthouse while traveling through the West of Ireland with a group of 7.
	Ellen greeted us upon arrival and was very gracious and helpful in getting us checked in and settled.</em>

	<em>This B&amp;B is in a great location very close to the center of town. The rooms were terribly good, lovely and spacious.
	The breakfast was one of the best we had on our entire trip. Great stay - couldn't recommend it more. </em></p>
